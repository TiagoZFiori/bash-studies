# bash-studies

This repository was created with the objective of taking notes and creating what can become useful documentation for my future endeavors related to Linux and scripting in general.

A lot of subjects will be covered here, as bash is a very capable tool.

Hopefully, it can be of some use to you!

Feel free and welcome to contribute!
